# Data Analysis Exercises for Advanced (Quantitative) Oceanography
This repository contains a collection of data exploration, analysis, and visualization excercises. These exercises accompany lectures in Advanced Oceanography. There are two main segments:
1. A set of Excel (or Apple's Numbers, LibreOffice's Calc, or Google Sheets) exercises.
2. A set of Python exercises.
The Python portion is the majority of the repository. 

## Credit
This repo borrows heavily from https://github.com/cgentemann/ocean_python_tutorial (*and maintains the LICENSE from that repo*) and https://github.com/ooi-data-lab/datalab-reu-2020. We are deeply indebted to the authors of those repositories for their hard work spinning these up. I have made changes based on updates to Python package management and in order to reinforce certain elements of the Advanced Oceanography lectures, but those original repositories were invaluable. Thank you for sharing your great resources!

## How to run Jupyter Notebooks in Advanced Oceanography
The easiest way to get started with Python is using Google Colab, which operates in the cloud (i.e., on Google's servers). All you need is a web browser. Our first Python exercises will draw heavily from Colab's getting started and overview notebooks.

For those who wish to go a little further and install Python (and important helpful tools) on their computers, we recommend the [Anaconda.org installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Once installed, run either a command of `jupyter lab` from the terminal or open the Anaconda Navigator app and open Jupyter Lab from there.

## Workshop: 
The original intent of much of the content here was, in the case of https://github.com/cgentemann/ocean_python_tutorial,  
"A one day introduction to Python for oceanographers to introduce oceanographers to Python programming and reproducible research using Jupyter Notebooks, Git, software citations, and cloud computing.  This hands-on course will use common oceanographic research analyses to demonstrate capabilities of Python, open source software libraries, and cloud computing."  
And, in the case of https://github.com/ooi-data-lab/datalab-reu-2020, the repository was oriented toward "the 2020 Data Labs Virtual Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), hosted by Rutgers University."
