To install python....

1.  You don't need to install the python programming language, instead you want to install a package manager, conda.  Conda manages all the software libraries for you.  There are two flavors of conda that are widely used.

2. Anaconda or Miniconda?

Miniconda.  While Anaconda is great (it has a nice interface and quickly downloads 1500+ libraries that you can just click on to use).  It takes up a lot of disk space on libraries that aren't especially relevant for ocean sciences. With Miniconda you install the libraries that you want, this makes it smaller, and also more controlled.  

# Install Miniconda:  Download Miniconda, Python 3.7 here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

# Install the downloaded file.  

# Open up an anaconda prompt
* Windows:  From your start button, look for Anaconda, within that folder open 'Anaconda Prompt'.  You are done, skip to next section on installing libraries.
* macOS: Open Launchpad, then open Terminal or iTerm.
* Linux–CentOS: Open Applications - System Tools - Terminal.
* Linux–Ubuntu: Open the Dash by clicking the upper left Ubuntu icon, then type “terminal”.

In the anaconda window type the following:
conda list

If Anaconda is installed and working, this will display a list of installed packages and their versions.


* type the following commands at your anaconda prompt:
conda create -n satenv
conda activate satenv
conda install xarray dask netCDF4 bottleneck scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn h5py jupyter basemap-data-hires
conda install -c anaconda xlrd distributed
conda install -c conda-forge palettable geopy cartopy satpy zarr podaacpy


* Once finished, let's open a Jupyter notebook:
At anaconda prompt type:
jupyter notebook
This will open a jupyter notebook in your browser.  From there you can open notebooks and run them.  It is probably easiest to navigate
to where you keep your code, create a new 'python' directory and organize your code into projects from there.  (This will also make using GitHub easier).

* Next time you want to code
Open your anaconda promt.  You will see (base) at the front of the prompt.  To get into your satenv and open a notebook type:
conda activate satenv
jupyter notebook

* Planning for the future
At some point you will want other libraries.  It is best to create a new enviornment for each project. 
You can do this by creating a new environment and then installing libraries in it.  Each time you start up, you will want to activate
the environment you will be working in .
conda create -n newenv
conda activate newenv
conda install   ..... some libraries....



to launch notebook: at anaconda prompt type:
jupyter notebook
this will open a jupyter notebook in your chrome browser.  from there you can open
notebooks and run them.
